## Features

- **Xbox Service Unlinking:** Prevent system communication with Xbox services by modifying the host file.
- **Fivem Cleanup:** Thoroughly remove traces of Fivem installations, including digital entitlements and configurations.
- **Temporary File Cleanup:** Enhance system hygiene by removing temporary files and directories.
- **Identity Spoofing:** Dynamically change unique identifiers across critical registry paths to evade detection.
- **Serial Display and Spoofing:** View current system serials and spoof them for additional obfuscation.

## Usage

1. Run the script as an administrator.
2. Press 'X' to initiate the spoofer, performing Xbox unlinking, Fivem cleanup, temporary file cleanup, and identity spoofing.
3. Press 'Z' to display the current system serials.

## How It Works

The Fivem spoofer is a Python script designed to manipulate system identifiers and unlink Xbox services to evade game bans. It runs with administrator privileges, enabling it to modify system files and registry entries. The script unlinks Xbox services, cleans temporary directories, removes specific files related to Fivem, and spoofs unique identifiers across various registry paths. Additionally, it provides functionality to display current system serials and spoof them using an external batch script. The spoofing process involves downloading executable and script files from Discord URLs, placing them in a specific directory, executing the batch script to modify system identifiers, and then cleaning up the downloaded files.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Windows operating system
